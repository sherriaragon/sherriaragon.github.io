<h2>Dostoevsky & Tolstoy</h2>
<p>This website is an HTML5 and CSS presentation. The site uses nested containers that are styled differently. The layout is a series of book images in three columns and two rows. The images on the Homepage are linked to respective summaries pages. The text for the summaries on subsequent pages is filler text. The images on subsequent pages are linked to their respective stories on Online-literature.com. Layout and the code for creating that layout are the primary objectives for this presentation. To view the code for this site go here: <a href="https://github.com/sherriaragon/sherriaragon.github.io/"><b>https://github.com/sherriaragon/sherriaragon.github.io/</b></a> and click on any HTML or CSS page. My <a href="aragonproject1guide.pdf"><b>how-to guide</b></a> for building an HTML5 website with external CSS is linked. View the "Overview" on Page 1 in the guide to know some of the differences between HTML5 and HTML and why people might want to learn it even though GUI environments are easier.</p>
<p>I recommend learning JavaScript in addition to HTML5 and CSS. Also, free hosting sites are only good for entertainment or informational content. If you're building a website to sell something, use a hosting site with secure payment capabilities to prevent fraud. Wix.com and Godaddy.com (et al.) are secure sites for this purpose. However, you will pay to register the domain name for one to two years, pay to host the site for the same term, and pay for secure payment capabilities. Most people don't have their own Web servers. Etsy.com is an easier option if you don't want the hassle. But all three of these hosting domains force you to use their templates, which I don't like. If you are writing original content, copyright your content. If you are writing the code and the content, copyright your site.</p>
<p>For the verbal presentation part of this assignment, I will record my desktop while building the Homepage, one subpage, and the CSS. The time limit is 4 minutes so it'll be the fastest build you've ever seen. I'll upload it here in MP4 format (if I can figure it out).</p>
